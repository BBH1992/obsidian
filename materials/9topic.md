# Customizing Obsidian for Academic Writing
## Creating custom templates for different types of academic documents
Creating custom templates in Obsidian for different types of academic documents is a powerful way to streamline your writing process and ensure consistency. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Identify Document Types
Identify the different types of academic documents you commonly work on. This might include research papers, project proposals, meeting minutes, or any other specific types.

### Step 2: Design the Template Structure
For each document type, design the structure you want to follow. This could include sections, headers, placeholders, and any standard content you typically include in that type of document.

### Step 3: Create Template Files
1. In your Obsidian vault, create a folder named "Templates" or any name you prefer to organize your templates.
2. Inside this folder, create a new Markdown file for each document type. For example, "ResearchPaperTemplate.md" or "MeetingMinutesTemplate.md."

### Step 4: Structure Your Templates
In each template file, structure the content based on your identified document type. Use Markdown syntax for headers, lists, and any other formatting you need.

```markdown
# Research Paper Template

## Abstract
[Enter Abstract Here]

## Introduction
[Enter Introduction Here]

## Literature Review
[Enter Literature Review Here]

## Methodology
[Enter Methodology Here]

## Results
[Enter Results Here]

## Conclusion
[Enter Conclusion Here]

## References
[Enter References Here]
```

### Step 5: Add Placeholders
Insert placeholders for information that will vary for each specific document. For example, use `[Enter Abstract Here]` or `[Author Name]` as placeholders that you can easily replace when using the template.

### Step 6: Save and Reuse
Save the template files in your "Templates" folder. Whenever you need to create a new document of a specific type, simply make a copy of the corresponding template file and start filling in the details.

### Step 7: Use Templater Plugin (Optional)
If you want to automate the insertion of templates, you can use the Templater plugin. Install the plugin and configure it to insert the content of your template files into new notes with specific triggers.

### Step 8: Customize and Update
Regularly review and update your templates based on your evolving needs. Consider feedback from your own experiences and from others who might be using your templates.

### Example: Meeting Minutes Template
```markdown
# Meeting Minutes Template

## Meeting Details
- **Date:** [Enter Date]
- **Time:** [Enter Time]
- **Location:** [Enter Location]

## Agenda
1. [Agenda Item 1]
2. [Agenda Item 2]
3. ...

## Attendees
- [Name 1]
- [Name 2]
- ...

## Notes
[Enter Meeting Notes Here]
```

Creating and utilizing custom templates in Obsidian provides a structured and efficient way to start new academic documents. It ensures consistency across your work and saves time by eliminating repetitive formatting tasks.
