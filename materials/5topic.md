# Citation Management

## Integrating reference managers with Obsidian.md

Integrating reference managers with Obsidian.md can enhance your academic writing workflow, allowing you to seamlessly manage and cite references. Here's a guide on how to integrate reference managers with Obsidian:

### 1. **Choose a Reference Manager:**
   - Select a reference manager that suits your needs. Popular options include Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote, or others.

### 2. **Export Bibliographic Data:**
   - In your reference manager, export bibliographic data for the relevant references in a compatible format like BibTeX, CSL JSON, or RIS.

### 3. **Organize References in Your Reference Manager:**
   - Organize and categorize references within your reference manager for easy retrieval.

### 4. **Store BibTeX Files in Your Obsidian Vault:**
   - Save the exported BibTeX files or other reference manager files directly into your Obsidian vault.

### 5. **Link References in Your Notes:**
   - Inside your Obsidian notes, create links to the BibTeX files using double square brackets (`[[reference.bib]]`).
   - This establishes connections between your notes and the corresponding bibliographic data.

### 6. **Use Citation Keys in Markdown:**
   - Utilize citation keys to cite references directly in your Markdown notes.
   - Reference managers often generate unique citation keys for each entry.

### 7. **Generate Citations Using Plugins or Scripts:**
   - Explore Obsidian plugins or external scripts that support citation rendering.
   - Some plugins may integrate with reference managers or allow you to manually specify citation styles.

### 8. **Pandoc Integration:**
   - If you use Pandoc for document conversion, leverage its citation features.
   - Include the BibTeX file in your Pandoc command, and use citation syntax in your Markdown notes.

### 9. **Sync Reference Manager Library:**
   - Ensure your reference manager's library is in sync across devices.
   - This ensures that the bibliographic data is always accessible when you're working on your notes.

### 10. **Explore Obsidian Plugins:**
   - Check if there are Obsidian plugins specifically designed to enhance integration with reference managers.
   - Community-developed plugins may offer additional features or automation.

### 11. **Use Zotero Better BibTeX (for Zotero Users):**
   - If you use Zotero, consider installing the "Better BibTeX" extension.
   - This extension provides advanced BibTeX export options and facilitates smoother integration with Obsidian.

### 12. **Regularly Update References:**
   - Periodically update your references in Obsidian to ensure any changes or additions in your reference manager are reflected.

### 13. **Collaborate on Shared Libraries:**
   - If collaborating with others, ensure that everyone involved has access to the shared reference manager library.
   - This helps maintain consistency in citations.

### 14. **Backup Your Reference Manager Database:**
   - Regularly backup your reference manager database to prevent data loss.

### 15. **Community Support:**
   - Engage with the Obsidian community or reference manager user communities for additional tips and best practices.

## Properly citing sources in markdown

By seamlessly integrating your reference manager with Obsidian.md, you can streamline the citation process and maintain a well-organized and interconnected knowledge base for your academic writing.

Properly citing sources in Markdown involves using citation keys and integrating them with citation styles. Here's a guide on how to cite sources effectively in Markdown:

### 1. **Choose a Citation Style:**
   - Select the citation style (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.) required for your academic writing. This determines the format of your citations.

### 2. **Create Citation Keys:**
   - In your reference manager, each entry should have a unique citation key. This key is used to link citations in your Markdown notes.

### 3. **Link to BibTeX Files:**
   - Store your BibTeX files or other reference manager files directly in your Obsidian vault.
   - Create links to these files in your Markdown notes using double square brackets (`[[reference.bib]]`).

### 4. **Citing Sources in Text:**
   - Use citation keys to reference sources within your Markdown text. For example:
     ```markdown
     According to studies in the field of psychology [@smith2020],...
     ```

### 5. **Format Citations:**
   - Format citations according to your chosen citation style. Each citation style has specific rules for in-text citations and the bibliography.

### 6. **Pandoc Citation Syntax:**
   - If you use Pandoc for document conversion, follow its citation syntax. For example:
     ```markdown
     According to studies in the field of psychology [@smith2020]...
     ```

### 7. **Linking Citations to Reference List:**
   - Create a dedicated section for your references at the end of your Markdown document.
   - Link each citation in your text to its corresponding entry in the reference list.

### 8. **Automate Citation Rendering with Plugins:**
   - Explore Obsidian plugins that support citation rendering. Some plugins can automatically format citations based on citation keys and styles.

### 9. **Include Additional Citation Details:**
   - Depending on your citation style, include additional details like page numbers or specific sections when referencing a source.

### 10. **Use Footnotes (if applicable):**
   - Some citation styles use footnotes for citations. Check the requirements of your chosen style and use footnotes accordingly.

### 11. **Regularly Check and Update Citations:**
   - Periodically review and update your citations, especially if your source material or reference list changes.

### 12. **Test Citations Before Finalizing:**
   - Before finalizing your document, test your citations to ensure they are rendering correctly.

### 13. **Collaborate on Citation Styles:**
   - If collaborating with others, ensure everyone follows the same citation style and uses consistent citation keys.

### 14. **Pandoc Citations with CSL JSON:**
   - If using Pandoc, export your citation data in CSL JSON format from your reference manager for more accurate formatting.

### 15. **Community Resources:**
   - Engage with the Obsidian community or other Markdown writing communities for tips and advice on citing sources in Markdown.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively integrate citations into your Markdown documents, ensuring accuracy and compliance with your chosen citation style.
