# Citation Management

## Integrating reference managers with Obsidian.md

Integrating reference managers with Obsidian.md can enhance your academic writing workflow, allowing you to seamlessly manage and cite references. Here's a guide on how to integrate reference managers with Obsidian:

### 1. **Choose a Reference Manager:**
   - Select a reference manager that suits your needs. Popular options include Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote, or others.

### 2. **Export Bibliographic Data:**
   - In your reference manager, export bibliographic data for the relevant references in a compatible format like BibTeX, CSL JSON, or RIS.

### 3. **Organize References in Your Reference Manager:**
   - Organize and categorize references within your reference manager for easy retrieval.

### 4. **Store BibTeX Files in Your Obsidian Vault:**
   - Save the exported BibTeX files or other reference manager files directly into your Obsidian vault.

### 5. **Link References in Your Notes:**
   - Inside your Obsidian notes, create links to the BibTeX files using double square brackets (`[[reference.bib]]`).
   - This establishes connections between your notes and the corresponding bibliographic data.

### 6. **Use Citation Keys in Markdown:**
   - Utilize citation keys to cite references directly in your Markdown notes.
   - Reference managers often generate unique citation keys for each entry.

### 7. **Generate Citations Using Plugins or Scripts:**
   - Explore Obsidian plugins or external scripts that support citation rendering.
   - Some plugins may integrate with reference managers or allow you to manually specify citation styles.

### 8. **Pandoc Integration:**
   - If you use Pandoc for document conversion, leverage its citation features.
   - Include the BibTeX file in your Pandoc command, and use citation syntax in your Markdown notes.

### 9. **Sync Reference Manager Library:**
   - Ensure your reference manager's library is in sync across devices.
   - This ensures that the bibliographic data is always accessible when you're working on your notes.

### 10. **Explore Obsidian Plugins:**
   - Check if there are Obsidian plugins specifically designed to enhance integration with reference managers.
   - Community-developed plugins may offer additional features or automation.

### 11. **Use Zotero Better BibTeX (for Zotero Users):**
   - If you use Zotero, consider installing the "Better BibTeX" extension.
   - This extension provides advanced BibTeX export options and facilitates smoother integration with Obsidian.

### 12. **Regularly Update References:**
   - Periodically update your references in Obsidian to ensure any changes or additions in your reference manager are reflected.

### 13. **Collaborate on Shared Libraries:**
   - If collaborating with others, ensure that everyone involved has access to the shared reference manager library.
   - This helps maintain consistency in citations.

### 14. **Backup Your Reference Manager Database:**
   - Regularly backup your reference manager database to prevent data loss.

### 15. **Community Support:**
   - Engage with the Obsidian community or reference manager user communities for additional tips and best practices.

By seamlessly integrating your reference manager with Obsidian.md, you can streamline the citation process and maintain a well-organized and interconnected knowledge base for your academic writing.
